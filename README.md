# Strucks

## Inspiration
Cargo theft is a big problem across the world. About $5 billion dollars worth of goods is stolen every year. Not only does this have a financial impact on the companies but a social impact on the public.

## What it does
Our work assists cargo companies and truck drivers to secure their cargo while on the road. By taking advantage of the dash camera, we used machine learning to recognize if the person sitting in the front seat is the correct driver. If the driver has a change in the face then a security company will be alerted. The emergency response teams will receive a message such as the one below:

```
ALERT! Your Truck has been hijacked! Driver:Steven VIN:4V4MC9EH7CN559763
Location:https://www.google.com/maps/place/45.454, -79.32234
```

## What's next for Strucks
If Strucks could be advanced further then there is potential for companies to save millions of dollars and lower crime rates across the world. If Strucks takes off then m.ore hardware components such as pressure plates to detect trailer detachment. We are also thinking of implementing blockchain transaction to unlock the truck cabin or detach the trailer.
